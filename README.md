🏏 IPL Win Prediction Model

This project predicts the winning probability of IPL teams using machine learning algorithms.
It analyzes historical match data, team performance, and venue statistics to estimate which team is more likely to win.

🚀 Features

. Data preprocessing and feature engineering from IPL datasets

. Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost (mention what you used)

. Interactive prediction interface (if you made a web app or Streamlit UI)

. Visualization of match trends and team strengths

📊 Dataset

. IPL matches dataset (from Kaggle or other sources)

. Includes team names, venues, toss decisions, and results

⚙️ Tech Stack

. Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

. Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

. Streamlit (optional for UI)

🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how data science and machine learning can be applied to sports analytics, providing insights into match outcomes and team performance.

💡 Future Improvements

. Incorporate player-level stats (batting average, bowling economy)

. Add live data prediction

. Improve accuracy with ensemble models
